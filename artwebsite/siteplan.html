			<p>Hello!  You can call me Ivory, and this is Works of Ivory, welcome to my studio!  Here you'll find some of my best works, and learn a little bit about me!  Hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
      <p>
        From my earliest memories, I've been captivated by the world of art. It all began with simple doodles on printer paper, using crayons and colored pencils to bring my imagination to life. My childhood was filled with a kaleidoscope of interests, from dragons and high fantasy realms to the iconic heroes of video games.

As I grew, so did my passion for drawing. I devoured drawing books, eager to learn how to recreate my latest obsessions with precision and flair. It wasn't long before I ventured into creating characters of my own, delving into the depths of character design through the vast expanse of the internet. Online communities became my classrooms, where I absorbed tutorials and feedback from fellow artists, honing my skills with each stroke of the digital pen.

One pivotal moment in my artistic journey came during my sophomore year of high school. I mustered the courage to submit a print of my original character to a school art show. Though I didn't clinch the top prize, the recognition and validation I received ignited a newfound confidence in my abilities. It was a turning point that propelled me to push my artistic boundaries further.

Fuelled by this newfound confidence, I immersed myself in the world of character drawing. YouTube became my sanctuary, where professional artists shared their expertise and offered invaluable critiques. Through relentless practice and a thirst for knowledge, I witnessed a remarkable transformation in my artistry.

Today, I find myself constantly evolving as an artist. While character design remains my forte, I'm eager to broaden my horizons by delving into intricate backgrounds and weaving compelling narratives for my creations. My journey is far from over, but looking back on my humble beginnings with printer paper and crayons, I'm filled with gratitude for how far I've come.

As I continue to tread this creative path, I'm driven by a sense of purpose and an insatiable hunger for growth. With each stroke of the brush or click of the mouse, I strive to breathe life into my imagination and share it with the world.

                “Here are some of what I feel are my best pieces of art.  Some are from several years ago, while others are more recent.  I spent a long time on many of these, averaging about 5 hours of work, the shortest taking around 3, and the longest taking upwards of 6 hours to complete.  All of the digital pieces were made with Clip Studio Paint Pro.”
